This is a repository containing a list of all the world seeds grabbed from a project called "NFT Worlds" which, on October 2021, created 10,000 non-fungible tokens (NFTs), each containing a link to an image depicting an isometric render of a world (specifically, its spawn area) generated using the sandbox video game *Minecraft*.

Two copies of the list are provided, one that sorts by token ID, and another by world seed, both ascending.

## Usage

Use Minecraft 1.17.1 to generate these same worlds shown in these images. Worlds generated in 1.17.1 are one-way upgradable to a newer version.

Starting in Minecraft 1\.18, the game's world generation has been overhauled, thus any new worlds generated there no longer resemble the old worlds shown from that certain project.

Outdated versions of *Minecraft* are not supported by Mojang Studios.  
You are advised to make them run in separate directories so that they do not conflict with the main files in the ".minecraft" folder. \([See this guide on how to do that.](https://minecrafthopper.net/help/guides/changing-game-directory/)\)
